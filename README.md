Because I have had to take more Math classes than I can count over the years, each with their fair share of graphing, I thought it would be cool
if I could use the shunting yard algorithm used by calculators to convert user expressions into calculations the program can compute and graph. My code can verify
user expressions for validity and draw with variable precision to reduce the needed computational/rendering power. Try it out!
